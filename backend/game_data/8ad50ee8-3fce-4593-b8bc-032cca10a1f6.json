Tell me:\n\n*   **What is the name of the spell?**\n*   **What is your target for the spell?** (Be it yourself, a creature, an object, or perhaps a general area within the tavern)\n\nThe patrons of the \"Wandering Wyvern\" shift uneasily. A gruff dwarf stops polishing his tankard, a hooded figure lowers their head further, and even the jovial bard pauses mid-strum. The very air crackles with anticipation. Choose wisely, and be specific. Your magic hangs in the balance!",

Without a focus, it will devour all, even the wielder. Tell me, what shall be its anchor in this world?",

However, in most role-playing games (RPGs), particularly those influenced by Dungeons and Dragons, simply *saying* \"I cast a spell\" isn't enough to make anything happen.\n\nThink of it like ordering food: you can't just say \"I want food!\" You need to specify *what* food you want.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening and what you need to do, based on the GM's and Eldor's reactions:\n\n*   **The Game Master (GM) is waiting for specifics:** The GM needs to know **exactly** which spell you're trying to cast, and **who or what** you're targeting with it. This is crucial for determining the spell's effects and resolving the action. The tavern patrons are reacting because spellcasting can have unforeseen consequences.\n\n*   **Eld",
