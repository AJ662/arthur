The weave of magic is intricate, and the details matter. What are the incantations you utter? What gestures do you make? And most importantly, what is the intended effect of this spell within the boisterous confines of the Crooked Tankard? Do you seek to illuminate the dimly lit corners, perhaps conjure a refreshing drink, or something... more dramatic? I await your response. The tavern holds its breath, anticipating the unfolding of your magical act. Even the barkeep, wiping down a tankard, pauses, his eyes narrowed in curiosity. Tell me, adventurer, what magic do you unleash?",

Or perhaps\u2026 a storm of consequences? The weave of magic is fickle. Be precise, lest the shadows answer a question you did not intend to ask. The echoes of your intent will ripple through this tavern, and beyond. So, tell me again... *what* do you cast?",

The Game Master (GM) and Eldor the Wizard (likely an NPC, or Non-Player Character, controlled by the GM) are prompting you for specific details about the spell you're trying to cast. They're not just asking *what* spell, but *how* you're casting it and *why*.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what they're looking for and why it's important:\n\n*   **Spell Name:** This is the most basic element. What's the name of the spell you're trying to use? (e.g., \"Fireball,\" \"Healing Word,\" \"Detect Magic\"). If you don't know the name, you need to make one up or describe its function.\n\n*   **Components:** Many spells require specific components \u2013 verbal, somatic (gestures), or material.\n\n    *   **",
